# Native Port Iteration Workflow

This workflow keeps routine replacement faithful while making the normal
iteration loop fast enough to port related code as a unit. It applies to
Milestone 4 native gameplay work; it does not weaken the release or milestone
acceptance criteria in [PLAN.md](../PLAN.md).

## Validation tiers

### Per slice

Run these after every bounded native change:

1. Incrementally build the affected Release targets.
2. Run the ROM-free core tests.
3. Run one Release ROM regression for the owning routine family. Extend that
   family regression with the new replacement count, normalized replay, and
   relevant artifact assertions instead of creating another full-route test.
4. Regenerate the admitted-routine registry when the slice added or changed an
   `@all` admission, and commit the regenerated table with the slice.
5. Run `git diff --check` and inspect resulting artifact hashes before
   recording them.

Release is the normal behavioral gate because deterministic state-census
routes execute substantially faster there. The tested native adapter must
still preserve the original instruction checkpoints, registers, timing, RAM
writes, and interrupt hand-off.

### Family checkpoint

Run Debug build/core coverage and the owning Debug ROM regression after a
related batch, before declaring that family complete, and before a milestone
or hand-off checkpoint. A related batch normally contains two to five sibling
routines that share a route, actor family, or state machine. Run Debug sooner
when a change affects transactional invocation, interrupt delivery, shared
memory helpers, undefined-behavior-sensitive code, or a previously unseen
branch.

The Debug ROM route is an audit, not a second required execution of every
single narrow slice. Do not run an additional focused Debug route when the
family regression already proves the same replacement count and artifact.

### Broad acceptance

Run all relevant Debug and Release ROM-backed regressions at milestone,
release, CI, or deliberate cross-family integration checkpoints. Use the full
suite when changing shared runtime, trace, checkpoint, save-state, or ROM-load
behavior.

## Regression design

- Prefer one family CTest invocation that observes all sibling routines and
  enables their replacements together. It should assert every newly admitted
  replacement count and at least one normalized replay per newly implemented
  branch.
- Add a separate focused ROM regression only when it exercises a unique route,
  branch, write scope, or artifact that the family regression cannot express.
  Mark its reason in the test and in `PROGRESS.md`.
- Keep pure-C/game-logic tests exhaustive for classifier states, malformed
  work RAM, and invalid slots. They are cheap and run on every slice.
- Do not bless a changed hash by itself. Explain the changed behavior, inspect
  call/write output, and preserve an original-assembly comparison first.
- Use the same family trace to profile several candidate sibling routines
  before choosing the next batch. A natural route is stronger evidence than a
  synthetic state patch.

## Fallback hotspot profiling

Use `tools/Analyze-NativeFallbackHotspots.ps1` to rank a bounded observer set
from one or more routine-call traces. It measures calls, master cycles, and
ordered writes, then assigns a transparent heuristic weight of total master
cycles plus 12 per write. The native dispatch registry automatically marks
registered addresses; all other observed addresses are assembly candidates.

The runtime deliberately records routine-call scopes only for explicit
`--observe-hook` addresses. This is therefore a measured candidate/family
profile, not a misleading whole-ROM call graph. Before selecting a batch,
observe the current native parent plus its likely continuation or sibling
addresses on a natural route, then rank them:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  .\tools\Analyze-NativeFallbackHotspots.ps1 `
  -CallPath out\build\windows-vs2022\candidate.calls.csv `
  -AssemblyOnly
```

Use `-AssemblyRoutine 02:4AEB` to force an address to be shown as an assembly
candidate when a deliberately broad experimental registration exists. Passing
multiple call traces combines their route weights; compare like-for-like
recording plans, not Debug and Release duplicates. Treat the result as a
prioritization aid: confirm each selected branch with its original transcript
before writing a replacement.

## Admitted-routine registry

A native replacement is deployable to live play only when a regression has
proven it for every naturally observed call at its address. That evidence lives
in the `--replace-hook <bank>:<pc>@all` invocations and the expected
`Native replacement <bank>:<pc>@all entries: <native> of <observed>` lines in
`tests/verify_*.cmake`. An admission proven only for a single ordinal is not
deployable: an ordinal names one call on one deterministic recorded route.

`tools/Generate-NativeRegistry.ps1` sweeps that evidence, cross-checks every
address against the dispatch chain in `src/app/native_replacements.cpp` and the
self-guarding `kRoutine` constants in the family sources, and writes the X-macro
table behind `admitted_native_routines()`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  .\tools\Generate-NativeRegistry.ps1 `
  -ReportPath .\docs\NATIVE_REGISTRY.md
```

The `dc_native_registry_manifest` test runs the same script with `-Check` and
fails when the checked-in table no longer matches the regressions, so a new
admission cannot silently skip the registry. The generated inventory and the
current coverage totals are in [NATIVE_REGISTRY.md](NATIVE_REGISTRY.md).

A partial route — fewer native calls than observed calls — is expected and
safe. Each handler re-checks its own entry state and returns no replacement for
a state it was not proven against, so those calls run the original assembly.

### Withheld routines

Admission is necessary but not sufficient. `02:57E9` and `03:6054` each pass an
`@all` regression, yet deploying either one alone moves the state census off
the assembly-only baseline, and each one's own regression expects the moved
hash rather than the baseline. Their evidence locks the divergence in instead
of catching it, so `kWithheldRoutines` in `src/app/main.cpp` holds both back
from every composed deployment — live play and cycle measurement alike. The
deployment summary names them on every run.

Their own regressions still drive them through `--replace-hook`, which is where
the divergence should be characterized. A withheld routine becomes deployable
once its regression expects the baseline census; remove it from the list then.

Check any new `@all` admission against the baseline before trusting it. A
regression that blesses whatever hash the recorder produced proves the routine
is deterministic, not that it is faithful.

### Stack depth is part of the proven shape

A replacement that reproduces a `JSR` must reproduce its pushes, and those land
at `$2100 + S`. Derive both cells from `entry.registers.stack_pointer`; never
write the recorded addresses as literals. A literal silently encodes the depth
the transcript happened to be recorded at, and the handler's own entry checks
will not catch a second call one level shallower — slot, registers, and status
can all match there.

This is not a cosmetic slip. The replacement writes the return bytes into cells
the real push never touched, the scheduler at `01:C5C9` pops whatever was
already in the real ones, and the processor resumes inside data and writes
through work RAM until the frame ends. The visible result is a game that dies
seconds later, far from the routine at fault.

`02:4DC8` shipped this way. Its single admitted call is the frame-872 table
setup at `S=$F3`; re-initializing the table after a drained ball reaches it
again at `S=$F2`, which wiped work RAM and made the second ball unplayable.
Eighteen sibling one-shot initializers carried the same latent defect. All of
them now go through `proven_stack_return`, which declines any depth but the
recorded one and derives the cells from it.

`--cabinet-drain-probe` is the regression for this class: it replays the quick
state hands-off until the ball drains, works the plunger, and fails on a ball
coordinate or ball count that leaves its range. Run it with the registry
deployed, since that is the configuration a session runs.

## Deploying to the interactive host

The interactive host installs the whole admitted registry before its first
frame, so a session on the cabinet executes every routine the regressions have
proven rather than the emulated original:

```powershell
.\devils-crush.exe --cabinet --rom "path\to\Devil's Crush.pce"
```

No flag is required — the registry is the default. `--emulate-only` opts back
out to the untouched assembly, which is the A/B control when a live session
misbehaves and the question is whether a native routine caused it.

The host prints the installed count on startup and the same deployment,
call, and cycle summary the recordings print on exit;
`--native-cycle-census <census.csv>` writes the per-routine breakdown for the
session that was actually played. `--registry-slice` and `--registry-exclude`
work here too, so a live-only misbehaviour can be bisected the same way a
changed census is.

The registry is installed after every fallible startup step and cleared before
the deployment it captures goes out of scope; nothing between those two points
returns early. `dc_rom_cabinet_smoke` drives the host through that whole path
with the registry deployed.

The horizon valve is identical to the one the recordings use: an atomic body
that would span a user event, a video event, or a serviceable timer interrupt
is declined and the original assembly runs. Live input arrives at
unpredictable offsets, so the host declines more calls than a deterministic
recorded route does. That is the valve working, not a defect.

## Measuring native cycle share

Per-address call counts cannot answer how much of a session runs natively,
because the runtime records call scopes only for addresses an `--observe-hook`
named. `--replace-registry` deploys the whole admitted set in one recording and
`--native-cycle-census` reports what it actually covered:

```powershell
.\devils-crush.exe --record-state-census out\registry.csv `
  --replace-registry --native-cycle-census out\cycles.csv `
  --rom "path\to\Devil's Crush.pce"
```

The census totals native body master cycles against the elapsed master-cycle
span, bracketed by the first and last registry entry of the run. Divide the
span by the frame count to sanity-check it: the state-census route yields
358,321 cycles per frame against the PC Engine's ~358,312, so the bracket
covers effectively the whole recording.

That recording is faithful by default: `--replace-registry` alone reproduces
the assembly-only baseline `9036a9de...`, because the state-diverging routines
above are withheld. A composed run that changes the census therefore indicates
a new problem rather than a known one.

`--registry-slice FIRST:COUNT` deploys a contiguous slice and
`--registry-exclude BANK:PC` holds one address back. Together they bisect a
composed run to the routine responsible for a changed census or a failed frame.

The measured baseline, taken on the 3,600-frame state-census route, is in
[NATIVE_REGISTRY.md](NATIVE_REGISTRY.md).

## Whole-ROM candidate profiling

`--instruction-profile` records every executed instruction address and its
master cycles with no keyed observer set, so it ranks code nobody has thought
to observe yet. It costs about 11% of recording wall time and does not perturb
the route: the state census is unchanged with profiling on.

```powershell
.\devils-crush.exe --record-state-census out\prof.csv `
  --instruction-profile out\profile.csv `
  --rom "path\to\Devil's Crush.pce"

.\tools\Analyze-InstructionProfile.ps1 -ProfilePath out\profile.csv `
  -ExcludeAddress "00:E323","00:E325"
```

The analyzer groups contiguous executed addresses into approximate routines,
ranks them by cycles, and marks the ones the registry already enters. Exclude
the frame-sync spin loop — `00:E323`/`00:E325` is 45% of all master cycles and
is the game waiting on the VBlank counter, not work to port.

### Cycle share is not the whole selection criterion

A candidate also has to fit its interrupt horizon, and the profile does not
show that. `08:40DF`, the sprite emitter, is the largest portable cluster left
at 7.77% of all master cycles, but its mean body is 1,328 cycles and it runs
inside the video window, where the user-event horizon is far shorter than the
~5,068-cycle timer period. The valve admits 535 of 73,818 calls, turning 7.77%
into 0.056%. `src/app/native_replacements_video.cpp` carries the measurement
and the two blockers.

Estimate acceptance before building an adapter: divide the candidate's mean
body by its call count and compare against the horizons its `RoutineEntry`
reports. A body that approaches a frame's event spacing needs a checkpointed
transcript, not an atomic one, and that is a materially larger job.

Note also what the harnesses do not cover. `--routine-replay` compares
registers, return state, relative cycles, and ordered work-RAM writes; the
work-RAM write observer does not capture hardware-page writes at all. A
routine whose real output is VDC port traffic can pass every available check
and still move the state census.

Profile before selecting a batch. Choosing by family narrative produced a
registry where 67 of 260 installed routines never execute on the route and 48
more never accept a call, while four addresses carry 79% of the native share.
Use this tool to pick the neighbourhood and
`Analyze-NativeFallbackHotspots.ps1` to profile the chosen family in detail.

## Commands

Assuming the full host preset has been configured and `DC_ROM_PATH` is
available to CMake:

```powershell
cmake --build --preset windows-release --target dc_core_tests devils_crush --parallel 8
.\out\build\windows-vs2022\tests\Release\dc_core_tests.exe
ctest --test-dir out\build\windows-vs2022 -C Release --output-on-failure -R '^dc_rom_<family>$'
```

At a family checkpoint:

```powershell
cmake --build --preset windows-debug --target dc_core_tests devils_crush --parallel 8
.\out\build\windows-vs2022\tests\Debug\dc_core_tests.exe
ctest --test-dir out\build\windows-vs2022 -C Debug --output-on-failure -R '^dc_rom_<family>$'
```

Run Debug and Release builds sequentially: multi-config CMake generation and
build output are shared. Do not run their builds concurrently.

## Future acceleration work

The next infrastructure improvement is a persisted routine-replay corpus:
record normalized pre-call save states and expected artifacts from an
authoritative family route, then replay adapters directly without booting the
entire 3,600-frame scenario. Until that corpus exists, batching sibling work
against a single Release family route provides the best speed/fidelity trade.
